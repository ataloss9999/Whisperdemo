# Requirements
Python3+

FFMPEG (sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg, manually download at https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html for windows*)

openai-whisper (pip install -U openai-whisper)

torch-cuda (Go to https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ for customized pip install command)

Cuda 12.4.0 (Go to https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive to download "CUDA Toolkit 12.4.0 (March 2024)")

 
Note : I might be forgetting something, I'll revisit this list later.
*You must add the Path variable for the FFMPEG binary. The quickest way I've found to do this is by searching for "Environmental Variables" with the windows searchbar. From there it should be relatively straight forward.
